#FIXME Address all of the following for the release:

* Reinstate header splits into .icc files. This also needs support in ncdevtool
  (e.g. cppmove mode) and ncrystal_repo_tools/core_components.py. Perhaps we
  need a new ncdevtool mode for doing the split?

* Compile and test also dmsc:ncrystaldev pkgs.

* Think about completely dissuading people from including specific headers in
  subdirs. Should we have an NCrystal/internal/CommonUtils.hh for plugins? Or AllInternal.hh?

     Might be nice if each component was ONE subdir (with inc and src subdirs),
    and they were included like "NCrystal/<compname>/bla.hh", but that these
    were all simply exported flatly in installations, where you would have a
    single NCrystal.hh, NCrystalInternal.hh, etc.  Issue: it might not be OK to
    include ALL header files in a single file?

* consider more ncdevtool checks:
    * shebangs consistent
    * check files left outside dirs, check no .icc file without .hh file.
    * use inspect module to find missing docstrings in modules and functions

* CI missing:
    * exercising embedded data with e.g. tests.
    * python coverage testing.

* Support (and test) windows paths starting with "\\?\", as well as shared
  directories starting with double slashes.

* pypi wheels: always build from sdist!

* A CI test which builds and installs ncrystal core WITHOUT a
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. Since that can be weird. We should then also test in a
  downstream project that everything from the find_package(NCrystal) is still correct.

* Migrate more tests from ncdevtool repo

* Create mother "ncrystal" python package + add optional dependencies in it.

* "ncdevtool find" mode seems broken.

* Open issue about migrating out ncrystal_geant4
* Open issue about getting plugins to work with a single pip install
