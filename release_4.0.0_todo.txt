#FIXME Address all of the following for the release:

* Reinstate header splits into .icc files.

* Think about completely dissuading people from including specific headers in
  subdirs. Should we have an NCrystal/internal/CommonUtils.hh for plugins? Or AllInternal.hh?

     Might be nice if each component was ONE subdir (with inc and src subdirs),
    and they were included like "NCrystal/<compname>/bla.hh", but that these
    were all simply exported flatly in installations, where you would have a
    single NCrystal.hh, NCrystalInternal.hh, etc.  Issue: it might not be OK to
    include ALL header files in a single file?
