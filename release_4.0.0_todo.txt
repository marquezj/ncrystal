#FIXME Address all of the following for the release:

* McStas needs PR to work with new release on Windows. Also we should retire the
  CMake code there related to windows.

* We should have a way to determine what version of NCrystal a given plugin was
  built against, so we can error on incompatibilities.

* Make sure pull requests have check boxes on top with stuff like "did you add a
  test", "did you mention any open issues this is linked to", etc.

* Make sure pypi.yml omly triggers for even patch numbers (in addition, we
  should only create even tags!). Document this policy.

* sb_devtools_gdb to simple-build-system??

* Compile and test also dmsc:ncrystaldev nclong pkgs.

* consider more ncdevtool checks:
    * shebangs consistent
    * check files left outside dirs, check no .icc file without .hh file.
    * use inspect module to find missing docstrings in modules and functions

* CI missing:
    * python coverage testing.

* Support (and test) windows paths starting with "\\?\", as well as shared
  directories starting with double slashes.

* "ncdevtool find" mode seems broken.

* Open issue about ncrystal-geant4 in the new location.

* Open issue about migration all plugins.

* Open issue about migrating more tests from ncdevtool repo

* Double check jupyter notebooks (especially interactively rerunning, plus on colab).

* One item which we can open an issue for: create ncrystal_test/ meta package
  which globs up stuff from tests/ (and possibly examples), and repackage the
  tests it in a way that ensures they can be launched against an existing
  ncrystal installation. That way, it would be possible to verify any
  installation with "pip install ncrystal-test && ncrystal-test ". At the very
  least, we could do this for pure-python tests.

* 'black -x --line-length 80 --check' on all python files + associated ncdevtool
  pyfmt mode?? clang-format on c++ files?

* plugin docs should contain this info: https://github.com/highness-eu/ncplugin-CrysText/pull/1#issuecomment-2624392374
* notify debian/freebsd people about new packaging.

conda install ncrystal-all
