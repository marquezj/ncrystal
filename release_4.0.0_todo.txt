* Verify wiki/Get-NCrystal.md (as it is referenced from e.g. openmc).

#FIXME Address all of the following for the release:

* Add a very temporary NCrystal/NCRNG.hh redirection header, to support openmc
  until their next release?

* update year in copyright statements (also in e.g. nxslib plugin).
* Update ncplugin_template with a readme which simply redirects to the new
  documentation.
* We should have a way to determine what version of NCrystal a given plugin was
  built against, so we can error on incompatibilities.

* Finally grep for 3.9.80, etc., to make sure any >3.9.8x is actually pointing
  at the last release candidate.

* Make sure pull requests have check boxes on top with stuff like "did you add a
  test", "did you mention any open issues this is linked to", etc.

* Make sure pypi.yml omly triggers for even patch numbers (in addition, we
  should only create even tags!). Document this policy.

* sb_devtools_gdb to simple-build-system??

* Are we 100% sure we are happy with the layout of files in ncrystal_core now?!??!?

* Reinstate header splits into .icc files? This also needs support in ncdevtool
  (e.g. cppmove mode) and ncrystal_repo_tools/core_components.py. Perhaps we
  need a new ncdevtool mode for doing the split?

* Compile and test also dmsc:ncrystaldev nclong pkgs.

* Think about completely dissuading people from including specific headers in
  subdirs. Should we have an NCrystal/internal/CommonUtils.hh for plugins? Or AllInternal.hh?

     Might be nice if each component was ONE subdir (with inc and src subdirs),
    and they were included like "NCrystal/<compname>/bla.hh", but that these
    were all simply exported flatly in installations, where you would have a
    single NCrystal.hh, NCrystalInternal.hh, etc.  Issue: it might not be OK to
    include ALL header files in a single file?

* consider more ncdevtool checks:
    * shebangs consistent
    * check files left outside dirs, check no .icc file without .hh file.
    * use inspect module to find missing docstrings in modules and functions

* CI missing:
    * exercising embedded data with e.g. tests.
    * python coverage testing.

* Support (and test) windows paths starting with "\\?\", as well as shared
  directories starting with double slashes.

* pypi wheels: always build from sdist! Also need CI which tests that sdist are complete.

* Conda packages and so forth should try to run "python3 -mNCrystal.test cmdline
  verbose", to verify they remembered all entry points!

* Prepare ncrystal-core, ncrystal-python, ncrystal packages.

* "ncdevtool find" mode seems broken.

* Open issue about migrating out ncrystal_geant4
* Open issue about migration all plugins.
* Open issue about migrating more tests from ncdevtool repo

* Double check jupyter notebooks (especially interactively rerunning, plus on colab).

* Branch master to main (also update wiki).

* One item which we can open an issue for: create ncrystal_test/ meta package
  which globs up stuff from tests/ (and possibly examples), and repackage the
  tests it in a way that ensures they can be launched against an existing
  ncrystal installation. That way, it would be possible to verify any
  installation with "pip install ncrystal-test && ncrystal-test ".

* 'black -x --line-length 80 --check' on all python files + associated ncdevtool
  pyfmt mode??

* Prepare simple-build-dgcode for new release.

* plugin docs should contain this info: https://github.com/highness-eu/ncplugin-CrysText/pull/1#issuecomment-2624392374
* ncrystal_python pkg should use src/ subdir for NCrystal?
