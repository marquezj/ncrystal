FILES               : This file.
data/...............: Material data files in NCrystals native format (.ncmat).
ncrystal_core/......: ncrystal-core package with C++ code, CMake code for
                      building it, and the ncrystal-config cmdline application.
ncrystal_python/....: ncrystal-python package with NCrystal python modules.
ncrystal_metapkg/...: NCrystal metapackage "ncrystal"
ncrystal_pypluginmgr: Source the ncrystal-pypluginmgr package, needed by dynamic
                      plugins.
CMakeLists.txt......: Configuration file for building and installing via CMake
                      (but see instructions in INSTALL first).
pyproject.toml......: Support building and installing via standard Python
                      (but see instructions in INSTALL first).
docs/...............: Extra documentation. Currently this is just ncmat_doc.md
                      with a thorough description of the NCMAT format.
tests/..............: Files and infrastructure for CTest-based tests.
examples/...........: Small standalone examples for using NCrystal, either from
                      the commandline, C, C++ or python applications or through
                      Geant4 simulations in C++.
                      Also included are templates for external plugins.
devel/..............: Developer utilities (including the ncdevtool command). It
                      also includes infrastructure for building with
                      simple-build-system, environment files, and the database
                      of external plugins.
ncrystal_geant4/....: Code for NCrystal-Geant4 hooks. Will eventually be
                      migrated to reside in another repository.
