ncrystaldynamic simplebuild bundle
==================================

This python module makes the ncrystaldynamic simplebuild bundle from
../simplebuild.cfg discoverable to simplebuild. However, it MUST be installed in
editable mode, so the python files are actually still at their real location in
the ncrystal repo clone (or possibly symlinks to the real locations).
