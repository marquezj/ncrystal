    A (silly) example shipped with ncrystal itself, serving as a template for
    other plugins. This example shows how to create a plugin which actually
    modifies scattering physics.

    Extra NCMAT data files for light and heavy water, covering a wider range of
    temperatures compared to what is found in the NCrystal standard library.

    The data files were based on ENDF/B-VIII.0 CAB scattering kernels by
    J.I. Márquez Damián, et. al. (DOI:10.1016/j.anucene.2013.11.014).
